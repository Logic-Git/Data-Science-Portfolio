# Introduciton
Welcome to the murder mystery challenge.  It is an SQL project available at https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries/tree/master. It consists of a large database (**sql-murder-mystery.db**) and the objective is to find a murderer using SQL queries from the large database.

**Prompt.pdf**: This file gives a detailed explaination of the prompt.

**sql-murder-mystery.db**: This is the database that you are required to query to complete the challenge.

**schema.png**: When completing the challenge, this is the file that you will have to refer to the most. It contains information about the structure of the databse so it helps the solver understand the information contained in the different tables in the database. Therefore, this file can be used along with the prompt to better understand what the challenge is and then to figure out which tables to query as the user solves the challenge. An importat thing to note about this file is that the golden key symbol in the image indicates that the column is the primary key for the table and the blue arrow symbol indicates that the column is the foreign key.

**murderer.ipnyb**: This file contains my code that I wrote to successfully complete the challenge.
