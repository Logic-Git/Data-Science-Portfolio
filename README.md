# Introduction
The following is a repository that reflects my Data Science Portfolio. It contains only some of the Data Science Projects that I have worked on and aims to reflect my competencies in the field. Each directory that can be seen in this repo contains a project that I worked on in the past. For example, the 'NLP-Contextual-Analysis' Directory contains an NLP project that I worked on.
