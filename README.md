# Introduction
The flowing is a repository that reflects my Data Science Portfolio. It contains only some of the Data Science Projects that I have worked on and aims to reflect my competencies in the field. Each Folder that can be seen in the files of this repo leads to another repository for a particular project that I worked on. For example, by clicking the repo named 'NLP-Contextual-Analysis @ f9e5a91' above, you will be led to another repo that houses a Natural Language Processsing Project I worked on.
